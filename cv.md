 *This course is an opportunity for me to learn a new profession from the very beginning. I had no previous programming experience, but when I got acquainted with programming, I got a lot of pleasure from studying. I want to master the course and discover new horizons for myself.*

**Since I have just started studying HTML-CSS-Javascript, I can't boast of any examples of my work at the moment, but I am sure that in the near future I will be able to achieve some results with the help of RS SCHOOL.**
